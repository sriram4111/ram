I have performed a comprehensive analysis of the laptop pricing dataset, which involved several key steps. Initially, I handled missing data by imputing appropriate values based on the mode and filled in 'No OS' entries with the most frequent value.

Additionally, I explored the dataset using various visualizations, such as bar plots, to examine the distribution of categorical variables like operating systems. Outliers and inconsistencies in the data were cleaned to ensure quality analysis. With these preprocessing steps, Iâ€™ve created a well-structured dataset that is now ready for modeling and deeper insights."
