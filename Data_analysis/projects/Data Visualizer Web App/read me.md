# Data Visualizer Web App ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the **Data Visualizer Web App**, a user-friendly and interactive tool for exploring and visualizing CSV data files. This application, built using **Streamlit**, allows you to quickly generate insightful visualizations without needing extensive coding knowledge.
This Streamlit web app allows users to visualize data from CSV files. Users can select a CSV file, choose the columns for the x and y axes, and select a plot type. The app will then generate the selected plot and display it on the screen.
