# Data Analysis using MySQL :

Completed the Data discovery and then used mySQL for data analysis.

SQL database dump is in db_dump.sql file above. Download db_dump.sql file to your local computer

**Importing Data to MySQL workbench**

![sql_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ef8940f-19ff-4100-896d-4848e21b397e)
![sql_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52c33cd8-280b-4666-896e-08687a18e6ea)


The import of data is done from an already existing MySQL file. This file has to be loaded into MySQL workbench for further data analysis.

Analysis of data by looking into different tables and reflecting garbage values

We can see that garbage value that the table market cantains certain values which are incorrect.

SELECT * FROM sales.market;

And then we can check that transacation table we can see that ceratin negative value in amount which is not possible. and we can see that certain transactions are in USD. Hence, filtration of that is also needed by converting into INR.

SELECT * FROM sales.transactions;

Analysis of different SQL statement on data base

1.To find of all customers records

SELECT * FROM sales.customers;

2.To find total number of customers

SELECT count(*) From sales.customers;

3.To find transactions for Chennai market (market code for chennai is Mark001

SELECT * FROM sales.transactions where market_code='Mark001';

4.To find distrinct product codes that were sold in chennai

SELECT distinct product_code FROM sales.transactions where market_code='Mark001';

5.To find transactions for Chennai market (market code for chennai is Mark002

SELECT * FROM sales.transactions where market_code='Mark002';

6.To find distrinct product codes that were sold in mumbai

SELECT distinct product_code FROM sales.transactions where market_code='Mark002';

7.To find transactions where currency is US dollars

SELECT * from sales.transactions where currency="USD";

8.To find transactions in 2020 join by date table

SELECT sales.transactions.*, sales.date.* FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020;

8.To find transactions in 2019 join by date table

SELECT sales.transactions.*, sales.date.* FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2019;

9.To find total revenue in year 2020,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r";

10.To find total revenue in year 2019,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2019 and sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r";

11.To find total revenue in year 2020, January Month,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.date.month_name="January" and (sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r");

12.To find total revenue in year 2020, February Month,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.date.month_name="February" and (sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r");

13.To find total revenue in year 2019, January Month,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.date.month_name="January" and (sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r");

14.To find total revenue in year 2019, February Month,

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.date.month_name="February" and (sales.transactions.currency="INR\r" or sales.transactions.currency="USD\r");

15.To find total revenue in year 2020 in Chennai

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.transactions.market_code="Mark001";

16.To find total revenue in year 2020 in Mumbai

SELECT SUM(sales.transactions.sales_amount) FROM sales.transactions INNER JOIN sales.date ON sales.transactions.order_date=sales.date.date where sales.date.year=2020 and sales.transactions.market_code="Mark002";

Similarly, if we want different of any other particular city the market code of that city is used on the mysql workbench.

Data Cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
In this process, we are work on data cleaning and ETL.

Step 1: Connect the MySQL database with the PowerBI desktop.

Step 2: Loading data into the Power BI deskstop. This step load all the tables and created in the data base. This load option will connect with the SQL and pull all the records into power BI environment.

In that model view looking up for model which form the star schema.

Setp 3: Transform data with the help of Power Query

Perform filtration in market‚Äôs table: In the tables perform when we click on the transform data option, we are directed to Power query editor. Power query editor is where we perform out ETL.and then we can perform data transformation i.e. Data Cleaning, Data Wrangling, Data Munging. we need to filter the rows where the values are null and filtering the data and deselecting the blank option.

Perform filtration in Transaction‚Äôs table: In the table perform when we check the query in the MySQL to filter some negative values -1 and also 0 values that appears in the table, the desired output is received and we will perform the similar filtration in PowerBI. we have deselecting the values, don‚Äôt want in the table. The result after filtration.

Convert USD into INR in the transaction‚Äôs table: the AtliQ Hardware only works in India so the USD values are not possible. we need to convert those USD values into INR by using some formulas. Add new column - Conditional column - normalized currency where sales amount will be in INR

In power query editore finding the total values having USD as currency.

 `=Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_sales_amount",each if [currency] = "USD" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount]`

# Data Modeling:
And then dataset was cleaned and transformed, it was ready to the data modeled.

The sales insights data tables as show below:



Data Source:

The dataset used for this analysis includes sales records from various outlets, detailing product characteristics and sales performance.
