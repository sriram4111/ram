# Churn Analysis DashboardðŸ“Š
In todayâ€™s competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Although this project focuses on churn analysis for a telecom firm, the techniques and insights are applicable across various industries. From retail and finance to healthcare and beyond, any business that values customer retention can benefit from churn analysis. We will explore the methods, tools, and best practices for reducing churn and improving customer loyalty, transforming data into actionable insights for sustained success.

# STEP 1 â€“ ETL Process in SQL Server

So the first step in churn analysis is to load the data from our source file. For this purpose we will be using Microsoft SQL server because it is a widely used solution across the industry and also because a full-fledged Database System is better at handling recurring data loads and maintaining data integrity compared to an excel file.
