# Churn Analysis Dashboardüìä
In today‚Äôs competitive business environment, retaining customers is crucial for long-term success. Churn analysis is a key technique used to understand and reduce this customer attrition. It involves examining customer data to identify patterns and reasons behind customer departures. By using advanced data analytics and machine learning, businesses can predict which customers are at risk of leaving and understand the factors driving their decisions. This knowledge allows companies to take proactive steps to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Although this project focuses on churn analysis for a telecom firm, the techniques and insights are applicable across various industries. From retail and finance to healthcare and beyond, any business that values customer retention can benefit from churn analysis. We will explore the methods, tools, and best practices for reducing churn and improving customer loyalty, transforming data into actionable insights for sustained success.

# Project Target

Create an entire ETL process in a database & a Power BI dashboard to utilize the Customer Data and achieve below goals:

Visualize & Analyse Customer Data at below levels,

Demographic,

Geographic,

Payment & Account Info,

Services,

Study Churner Profile & Identify Areas for Implementing Marketing Campaigns,

Identify a Method to Predict Future Churners.

# STEP 1 ‚Äì ETL Process in SQL Server

So the first step in churn analysis is to load the data from our source file. For this purpose we will be using Microsoft SQL server because it is a widely used solution across the industry and also because a full-fledged Database System is better at handling recurring data loads and maintaining data integrity compared to an excel file.

# Creating Database

After installation, you will land on the following screen. Do remember to copy paste the server name somewhere because we will need this at a later stage. Also enable the checkbox which says ‚ÄúTrust Server Certificate‚Äù and then click on Connect

Once connected, click on NEW QUERY button at the top ribbon and then write below query. This will create a new Database named db_Churn

CREATE DATABASE db_Churn
 

Import csv into SQL server staging table ‚Äì Import Wizard

Right click on the newly created database in the explorer window and then go to

Task >> Import >> Flat file >> Browse CSV file

Remember to add customerId as primary key and allow nulls for all remaining columns. This is done to avoid any errors while data load. Also make sure to change the datatype where it say Bit to Varchar(50). We are doing this because while using import wizard I faced issues with the BIT data type, however Varchar(50) works fine.

# Data Exploration ‚Äì Check Distinct Values

SELECT Gender, Count(Gender) as TotalCount,
Count(Gender)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Gender
 

SELECT Contract, Count(Contract) as TotalCount,
Count(Contract)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Contract
 

SELECT Customer_Status, Count(Customer_Status) as TotalCount, Sum(Total_Revenue) as TotalRev,
Sum(Total_Revenue) / (Select sum(Total_Revenue) from stg_Churn) * 100  as RevPercentage
from stg_Churn
Group by Customer_Status
 

SELECT State, Count(State) as TotalCount,
Count(State)  1.0 / (Select Count() from stg_Churn)  as Percentage
from stg_Churn
Group by State
Order by Percentage desc
